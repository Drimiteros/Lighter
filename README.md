# Lighter v2.5 ðŸ’¡
A simple to use 2D dynamic lighting library made with SFML 2.6.0!

## Link ðŸ”—
* You need to link SFML first. If you don't know how to, there is a cool video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFzpkvrscs4&t=127s 
* Linking Lighter is a super simple process. Just include the .cpp and .h file to your project src directory and you have access to Lighter.

## Features âœ…
* Simple implementation to your project
* It works with SFML 2.6.0+
